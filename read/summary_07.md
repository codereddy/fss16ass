<h3>The four most important keywords:</h3>
<ul>
<li>ii1  RapidMiner: RapidMiner is a software platform that provides an integrated environment for machine learning, data mining, text mining, predictive analytics and business analytics.
</li><li>ii2 Linked Open Data: Linked Open Data (LOD) is Linked Data which is released under an open licence, which does not impede its reuse for free.
</li><li>ii3 Semantic: relating to meaning in language or logic.
</li><li>ii4 Data Mining: The practice of examining large databases in order to generate new information.
</li></ul>

<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<ul><li>iii1 Motivational Statement: The linked open data (LOD) approach will be presented as a new possibility in support of complex and inter-disciplinary data mining analysis. 
LOD offers unique and new possibilities for interdisciplinary data analysis, modeling and projection for multidimensional, complex landscapes and may facilitate new insights and answers to complex environmental questions.
Their research aims to encourage those research scientists which do not have extensive programming and data mining knowledge to take advantage of existing data mining tools, to embrace classical data mining and LOD approaches in support of gaining more insight and recognizing patterns in highly complex data sets.
</li><li> iii2 Informative visualizations:
They use flow charts to show different kinds of procedures in data minning. They also use horizontal bar chars to show the distribution of voters on data minning tools.
CIR images from hyperspectral sensors. Semantic network to describe the relationships of Oscar’s family members with one another. Conceptual LOD Modell of semantic link of open data in medical research using the example of disease diagnosis through magnetic resonance tomography (MRT).
</li><li> iii3 Hypotheses: Linked Open Data approach will be presented as a new possibility in support of complex and inter-disciplinary data mining analysis. 
LOD data mining is advantageous compared to classical data mining techniques. LOD offers unique and new possibilities for interdisciplinary data analysis, modeling and projection for multidimensional, complex landscapes and may facilitate new insights and answers to complex environmental questions.
</li><li> iii4 Tutorial materials: There are links provided to papers talking about different data mining techniques. They gave links to papers discussing regression methods like linear regression, classification tehcniques like dscision trees, random forests and naive bayes.

<h3>Improve paper</h3>
<ul><li>iv1 If they took any non data mining tools as baseline to compare to the tools mentioned here
</li><li> iv2 If they mentioned the advantages and disadvantages of the tools mentioned here.
</li><li> iv3 The discussion is very big. It can be more precise
</li><li> iv4 They did not explain why they chose the data sets the chose.
