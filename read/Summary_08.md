<ul>
<li>ii1 Cancer Immunotherapy: The prevention or treatment of disease with substances that stimulate the immune response.   
</li><li>ii2 Immuno-oncology: It is an approach that uses body's immune system to fight cancer.
</li><li>ii3 Ipilimumab: is an antibody that works to activate the immune system by targeting CTLA-4, a protein receptor that downregulates the immune system.
</li><li>ii4 Prediction of analysis time: It encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from predictive modeling, machine learning, and data mining that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about things in future time.

<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<ul><li>iii1 Motivational Statement: Parametric mixture cure rate models with the best fit to empirical clinical trial data were proposed to predict analysis times in immuno-oncology studies during the course of the study. 
The proposed prediction procedure also accounts for the mechanism of action introduced by cancer immunotherapies, such as delayed and long-term survival effects. 
<li><li> iii2 Results: The proposed methodology was retrospectively applied to a randomized phase III immuno-oncology clinical trial.The Weibull mixture cure rate model was the best-fitting distribution to the empirical data of this phase III randomized clinical trial, with both treatment arms combined for all 6 interim databases.
The unique survival kinetics of cancer immunotherapy was captured in the longitudinal predictions of the final analysis times.
</li><li> iii3 Related Work: Various parametric and non-parametric models have been proposed to predict the timing of analyses which had the assumption that all patients in the study population are susceptible to the event of interest and will eventually experience an event during the monitoring window. 
</li><li> iii4 Tutorial materials: Parametric mixture cure rate model has been explained in detail with mathematical equations and links to papers are also given that point to it.

<h3>Improve paper</h3>
<ul><li>iv1 They do not talk about why they used the specific data they used.
</li><li> iv2 They can mention the software or language used to carry out the experiment
</li><li> iv3 Missing future work: They did not explain how exactly will their results be used to do future work.
</li><li> iv4 There can be links explaining some of the data they used, it is very difficult for someone who does not have the background to undestand the used data or concepts.
